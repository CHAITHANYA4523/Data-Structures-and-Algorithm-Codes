//Approach
/*
This approach uses bfs traversal because we go on replacing the characters one by one which seems just like weâ€™re moving level-wise in order to reach the destination i.e. the targetWord.
take each word and change each letter of word and compare it with words in wordList and count steps.
use a set to remove already visited words in the wordList.

Time Complexity: O(N * M * 26)
Where N = size of wordList Array and M = word length of words present in the wordList..
Note that, hashing operations in an unordered set takes O(1) time, but if you want to use set here, then the time complexity would increase by a factor of log(N) as hashing operations in a set take O(log(N)) time.

Space Complexity:  O( N ) { for creating an unordered set and copying all values from wordList into it } Where N = size of wordList Array.
